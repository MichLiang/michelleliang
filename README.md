## Student Pharmacist at University of Waterloo, Digital Artist at home

Hi, my name's Michelle, and I'm currently a third year pharmacy student working at Costco Wholesale Pharmacy, in Waterloo and Guelph. On the side, I enjoy creating art, learning about graphic design, and trying my hand at learning how to code.
