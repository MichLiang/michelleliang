# Student Pharmacist at the University of Waterloo, Digital Artist at home

Hi, my name's Michelle, and I'm currently a third year pharmacy student working at Health Canada. On the side, I enjoy creating art, learning about UI/UX, and trying my hand at learning how to [code](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/523471870).
