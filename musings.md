title: Books of 2023 - 2024

> Recently, I've started dabbling in reading again (mainly recommendations from friends, family, NYT best sellers, and BookTok). I've collected some thoughts here, mostly to help myself keep track.

### 2024 Reads:
4/10 | The Invisible Life of Addie Larue by V. E. Schwab
  - I don't really feel like there was a plot in this book. The writing itself was quite lyrical, but I found it hard to get through.

4/10 | The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller
  - The beginning was very slow and I was a bit disappointed about how Patroclus wasn't portrayed as one of Achaeansâ€™ most formidable warriors (Achilles' equal) like in the Iliad.
  - But the ending was great and I was pleasantly surprised with how the pace picked up.

### 2023 Reads:
8/10 | A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins 
  - Mostly wanted to read this prior to the movie coming out, and the Hunger Games trilogy was one of my favourite series growing up.
  - Really enjoyed this book, but the turn at the very end felt a bit rushed.

9/10 | When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi
  - I never tended to reach for non-fiction, but this memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis was a fantastic read. I read this while working in oncology, and it gave me a lot to think about.
  -  Foreword by Abraham Verghese was hagiographic and contradictory. The epilogue written by Dr. Lucy Kalanithi however, was one of the most heartbreaking, stunning, and eloquent pieces I've read - she is a natural writer.

6/10 | A Court of Mist and Fury (ACOMAF) by Sarah J Maas
  -  I heard the second book of the series was incredible despite my experience with the dismal first. Unfortunately, it was not all that much better in my opinion. Also did not like Rhys, he made me feel uncomfy.

4/10 | A Court of Thorns and Roses (ACOTAR) by Sarah J Maas
  - The writing felt very unpolished and inconsistent and I could not relate to the main character at all. Also, ellipses just showed up in the oddest places.

8/10 | Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens
  - Getting through the first half of this book and getting used to the dialogue was dreadful, but I stayed up until 2am finishing the second half.

9.5/10 | Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros
  - Found the characters/dragons to be very likable, and the book felt like a combination of HP, Divergent, Hunger Games, Eragon, and GoT. A fun read!

2/10 | Happy Place by Emily Henry
  - Perhaps romance is just not my genre, but it took me months to finish this one. Felt there wasn't any plot, and the main character gives up her years of medical school and residency training to suddenly pursue pottery.

7/10 | Verity by Colleen Hoover
  - Did this thriller give me nightmares? Yes. Was this an entertaining read? Also yes.

6.5/10 | Throne of Glass by Sarah J Maas
  - The main character gave "I'm not like the other girls" vibes and I'm surprised I managed to finish this book. In hindsight, I'm unsure why I rated it so high.

7.5/10 | The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Reid
   - This was a historical fiction based loosely on the lives of Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, and I loved reading about old Hollywood. The main character Evelyn was complex and flawed, but I was captivated by her resilience and ambition.

4/10 | It Starts With Us by Colleen Hoover
  - This sequel felt a bit unnecessary, and although it was a happy ending, I felt it could've been summed up as an epilogue in the original book.

7.5/10 | It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover
  - I have to give this book kudos, because after I DNF'd two other books, this one finally pulled me out of my 10-year reading slump. It's a quick read.
  - I did not expect it to be about domestic abuse (it's marketed as a romance novel).
